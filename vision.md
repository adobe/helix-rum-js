# RUM Vision

## Privacy first

We adhere to the principles of [Datensparsamkeit](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Datensparsamkeit.html) and abhor the use of personally identifiable information. We counteract fingerprinting and other means 
of diluting visitor privacy.

## Minimalism

Implementation should take as little work as possible. Instead, RUM will understand the experience and attaches itself to interesting events.

## Uniformity

To ensure uniformity and universality of the collected data, only one direction of customization should be supported: to gather less data, not more.

## Interactions over Implementations

We care more about how people interact with experiences than how the experiences are implemented. Therefore we stay as close to the user interface as possible.
